# website_scraper.py

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_website(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    # Add your scraping logic here
    # ...
    # ...
    # Return the scraped data
    return scraped_data
```

This is a basic skeleton code for the website scraper. You can add your own scraping logic inside the `scrape_website` function. Make sure to install the required dependencies `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` before running this code.
